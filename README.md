 Data Science Workflow  #### 1. Data Preprocessing - Clean and prepare raw data - Handle missing values, scale features, encode categorical variables - Split datasets into training and testing sets  #### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Analyze and visualize data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships - Generate summary statistics, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps - Identify outliers or anomalies  #### 3. Model Development - Build and train machine learning models - Utilize Random forests algorithm  #### 4. Model Evaluation - Assess model performance using metrics and techniques - Use cross-validation, ROC curves, confusion matrices, and calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC  #### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning - Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters - Employ grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the best model  #### 6. Feature Engineering - Create or transform features to enhance model performance - Apply techniques such as one-hot encoding, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and create interaction or polynomial features  This workflow ensures a comprehensive approach to building and refining data science models.
